# landgenomic_analysis

These scripts were developed to perform landscape genomic analysis including: SNPs dataset filtering (1), population genetic structure (2), climatic data selection (3), fine-scale spatial genetic structure (4), identification of potential candidate loci using three approaches, pcadapt (5), RDA with Mahalanobis distance (6) and LFMM2 (7), result comparison with Venn Diagram (8), RDA using only the candidate SNPs (9), adaptive genetic maps using sPCA (10) and genetic variation predictions using RDA (11).

We suggest to run the scripts in the following order, because new VCF files will be used in the subsequent steps:

1 - Filtering

2 - Population Structure

3 - Climatic Data

4 - LOESS

5- PCAdapt

6 - GEA_RDA_Mahalanobis

7 - LFMM2

8 - Venn Diagram

9 - RDA_final

10 - sPCA

11 - RDA_predict
