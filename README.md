# LanGen_pipeline

These suit of scripts were developed to perform the following analysis: 

1) SNPs dataset filtering 
2) Assessment of population genetic structure 
3) Selection of environmental data 
4) Assessment of fine-scale spatial genetic structure 
5) Identification of outlier (adaptive) loci using pcadapt 
6) Identification of genotype-environment associations using Redundancy Analyses (RDA) & Mahalanobis distances 
7) Identification of genotype-environment associations using Latent Factor Mixed Models (LFMM2) 
8) Plotting detections with a Venn Diagram 
9) Visual assessment of genotype-environment associations using Redundancy Analyses (RDA) on the candidate loci
10) Mapping adaptive genetic variation using Spatial Principal Components (sPCA)
11) Predicting adaptive genotypes from RDA models and environmental data
